# Fish_image_classification
Problem Statement:
This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple categories using deep learning models. The task involves training a CNN from scratch and leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained models to enhance performance. The project also includes saving models for later use and deploying a Streamlit application to predict fish categories from user-uploaded images.

 The CNN model was built from the scratch and trained and the data augmentation has been performed to enhabnce the model. Through transfer learning the EFFICIENTNET B3 model is trained and the data preprocessing and data augmentation are done to ernhance the efficiency and the accuracy of the model. Then the trainee model has been save in the keras format and has been loaded in the stremlit application for the predicting the fish image classification.
